            <h2>Living in Korea</h2>
            <p>Korea is a vibrant country with a rich cultural heritage and modern innovations. Here are some highlights of life in Korea:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Food:</strong> Korean cuisine, including dishes like kimchi, bulgogi, and bibimbap, is world-famous.</li>
                <li><strong>Culture:</strong> Traditional music, dance, and Hanbok (traditional attire) reflect Korea's history.</li>
                <li><strong>Landscapes:</strong> Korea offers stunning mountains, beaches, and cities like Seoul and Busan.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I have lived in korea for about 10 months. I am staying in the 2nd largest city of korea, Busan. I arrived in Korea in March 7th 2024. Korea is completely different from
                    My home country Nepal. In korera I have travelled to many places in Busan such as Huaendae beach, Gangwali Beach Namcheon cultural Village. I am Studiying in Tongmyong 
                    University. I am a second semester student. I have met many local peopl during my stay and they have been very accomodating and friendly towards me. Even when I am having some 
                    problems they have helped me without excepting anything in return. My stay in Korea has been very pleasent and full of happiness.
